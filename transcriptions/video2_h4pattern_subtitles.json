And everyone always asks me what's the best part about your job. The best part about it truly is that I only trade an hour and a half every single day. So whether you work a 9 to5 or you just want some extra income or you're retired and want to get into trading, this video is for you. This strategy works for every single one of you. After I give you the framework today and absolutely everything I use, you will never need to watch another trading video again. And this will give you absolutely everything you need to finally start making money in these markets, whether that's on a personal account or through prop firms. So, let's not waste any time and I'll dive straight into what took me from that broke university student to where I am now. So, on my screen, we have the NASDAQ 4 chart. Now, I trade primarily NASDAQ. What I'm about to show you works for Forex. It does as well. I would recommend you all start to trade NASDAQ because the there's one specific 4hour candle on the NASDAQ that gives me absolutely everything that, like I mentioned, has made me six figures plus, and it's this one 4hour candle. Now, you can trade the 9:00 a.m. 4hour candle. Everything I'm about to tell you, by the way, is New York time EST. You can trade the 9:00 a.m. 44hour candle on forex. If you are going to do that, you would take the same things I teach in this and just apply it to forex. But I'm going to teach this on NASDAQ because that's what I trade. So what are we actually trying to do? All we are trying to do is say where is the 4hour candle going? That is the 10:00 a.m. 4hour candle. So I'm looking at this chart and I'm going okay where is the 10:00 a.m. 4hour candle going? Now how we align ourselves with this is through the framework. We have to build some framework in. So framework to me and we'll dive into exactly what it is is things like premium and discount and fair value gaps. So for example here this 10 a.m. 4hour candle this one here right 6 a.m. reacted off of a fair value gap in a premium market. What you want to do is ask, okay, are we in a discount or premium? This at this point is clearly a premium market because when we're at this point, we are trading below. We're trading in this range, this range low to this range high. Okay? We're working within there. The top half of that is a premium as you all know. Now, what you want to be able to do is say, where is the 4hour candle going? The 10 a.m. 4hour candle. Now, I'm waiting for 6 a.m.'s 4hour candle to tip its hand to me. That's all I'm doing as a trader. I'm waiting for 6 a.m. to tip its hand to me. Then, if 10:00 a.m.'s predictable, I'm trading it. So, what does that look like in practice? If we keep this in mind, we've built in the framework. We're in a premium. Price is clearly trading lower. What is order flow? That's another question you should ask. What is orderflow? Well, we're respecting up close candles and trading away from them. We are not trading through up close candles bullishly. We are respecting them and trading down. All right, every up close candle that's important to price. We are respecting and trading lower and watch this whole video because there will be a lot of gems that I don't just give in the first few minutes. All right, I'll get into sessions and which specific 4hour candles are important for your key levels. So, which order blocks are important? Which fear gaps are important? And guys, there's a specific reason this order block and this proportion block here are very important, and I'll get into that. It's to do with time, things that no one's taught before. Now, if you look at 6 a.m., it trades above 2 a.m.'s candles high. So, we've got a range high taken, and I'll get into this on the lower time frame. Then, we trade into a key level. Not only this proportion block, but it is also a 4hour fair value gap inside of a premium. You've been told before you only short inside of a premium and you only long inside of a discount. That holds true. You just do premium and discount wrong. Right? So when this closes, what did 6 a.m. candle actually do? Let's align what it did where it traded above 2 a.m. high into a 4hour key level and then we also disrespected a fair value gap. Notice how 6 a.m.'s candle closed below this fair value gap. Let me ask you, if you were going to go long, if you wanted to long, where would you rather long from below these lows or when we're up here? Simple question, right? And I ask this all the time to to the onetoone students. If you wanted to go long, flip your bias. You want to short. So, if you wanted to go long, where would you feel comfortable longing from? This area or when we take out all these lows? Because these are relatively equal lows. The answer clearly is when we take out all these lows. So with that logic, keep that there. Put a pin in that thought. When we close below a fair value gap here, is it not logical to say the next candle should trade below these lows? Because let's say in hypothetical, sorry, we did want to go long. Would you rather long again up here or when we take out these equal lows, these equal lows, right? Because then sellside liquidity is trapped. People are selling this. Okay. and people are buying this. So with that logic in mind, if we then respect a key level, isn't it logical to say the next 4hour candle should expand lower? And that's exactly what we do. So at this point here, with all that logic built in, guys, you have to build narrative and you have to build story behind your trading. With all that logic built in, we can now say the 10:00 a.m. 4hour candle is predictably bearish. All right. So what are we actually looking for to get on side with it now? Well, specifically we are looking for an open, a high, a low, and a close of what? Of that 4hour candle of the 10 a.m. 4hour candle. So, if we look at 10:00 a.m., where does 10 a.m. actually open up here? So, what you want to see for 10 a.m. 4-hour candle and if I put my dividers on this. All right, if I put my dividers, that's the 10 a.m. 4-hour candle. That's the start of it. What you want to see is an open, a high, a low, and a close. If you're bearish, this is what you want to see. If you are bullish, you want to see open, low, high, close, right? And how do we visualize this? Well, let's say this is the open of a candle. This is the high, and then this is the low, and this is the close. All right, follow along. It's very important. If the 10 a.m. 4hour candle is predictably bearish, this is how I get on side with it. Open, high, low, close. And you reverse it if you were bullish. So if I was bullish, open, low, high, close. What portion do you think I'm trading? I am trying to catch this portion. Okay. Anywhere in this portion I am trying to catch. Or if I'm bearish, this portion. Okay. after the open to highs been created. Now, if you take a look, are we shorting when 10 a.m. drops straight down? No. Because there's no open to high portion created yet. If we think about the 4hour candle, it should look like this. We want an open to high. Why is that? So, we can reach a premium level. Anything, right? And here's a very important thing to note down. If you are bearish, anything above that candle's opening price is a premium. Stop waiting for price to get all the way up here or all the way back into a premium of a dealing range. We're not trading a dealing range. We're trading an expansion candle. Anything above the open of that candle is a premium. So price opens up there, trades lower. Are we selling this? No. That's what retail do. Retail sell when it's going down. We sell when it's going higher. So we have the opening price. That right there, that orange line is 10 a.m.'s open. Do you think we're going short below or above that opening price? Above. Right. Logically, because we are smart money and we call ourselves smart money, we have clues to what price is actually doing, where it's actually going. We would rather short above 10:00 a.m. open. That would make way more sense than shorting all the way down here, right? That would make way more sense naturally. So what you are doing is you are waiting for the open to high to be created. Then you can even drop time frame and this is how I engage with price. You can drop time frame after we're above the 10:00 a.m. opening price. And what you are looking for is an inverse F value gap or or you are looking for a change in the state of delivery. So this is 10 a.m.'s open and keep that in mind. We are above 10 a.m.'s open. So when we close below there, I am going short because now I've built in the logic. I am confident enough to say price should go lower. Price is predetermined to go lower. So when we close below those candles, I can enter a short because that 10 a.m. candle is now predictable. Not just predictable, but the reason it's predictable is because I've built in so much logic that I'm happy to take a loss. Now, this is why you guys get stopped out all of the time. You get stopped out because you're not trading the 10 a.m. open. you're trading before it and you get chopped up. Okay, you get chopped up above these highs. Wait for that new relative premium. And I call it a relative premium or a dynamic premium. It doesn't matter to me. Whatever it's called. The portion that goes higher above the opening price when you're bearish. That is your premium. Stop waiting for a massive run. The move's gone. The move's already happened. So, anything above 10 a.m.'s opening price is a premium. This is why I've told you guys for to be honest years that you only need one candle. All right? And everyone on YouTube has gone and copied that saying, you only need one candle because the video did well. And now look, they're teaching it wrong. You're still in the same place. It's cuz you're not trading it properly. So I would enter on the displacement of this candle here, right? And my stop loss would go above the bodies here. And usually I target a 1 to2 or a 1 to three. You will see this happen all of the time. You need that extra confirmation after we trade above 10 a.m.'s opening price. Now, let's go back to the 4 hour and remember the logic. All of this came from us trading first of all inside of a premium. Now, us trading inside of a premium alone is not important. If the market's going lower, then it's important because now we think it's going lower. Why do I think this market is going lower? Well, we have lots of liquidity here. Now, what I want you to start asking yourself is when you load up the market, is there smooth liquidity above or below me? So, open up your 4hour chart and say, is there smooth liquidity above or below me? So, when we're waiting here on this new day on Thursday, literally yesterday at the time of recording, is there smooth liquidity above me or below me? Well, okay, there's a few highs here, but if we zoom out a little bit, these are all equal lows. There's a lot of liquidity. Everyone who went long here, where do you think their stop losses are? Below all these lows. So, excuse me. There's smooth liquidity below us. Because we've taken multiple stabs higher. This is jagged highs. So, this is not smooth liquidity. The smooth liquidity is below us. So price then when it starts trading through up close candles, oh sorry when it starts respecting up close candles and trading through down close candles that's when it's your signal that you are on side with bearish order flow. Now you are just waiting for 10:00 a.m. Most of you can't wait for 10:00 a.m. What else confirms the fact that we're bearish? Well, logically if we wanted to go long, you have a discount key level here. Notice how 6 a.m.'s candle closed below this level as well. Notice how we also didn't respect it here. We just displaced through it. So, let me ask you something. If you have a discount key level, do you want it to be respected or cut through for longs? Right. Simple question. If you have a discount key level and if you wanted to go long, would you want to see it respected or would you want to see it cut through? Respected. Obviously, if you're wanting to go long and we hit a discount key level, you want to see it bounce away from that key level. Did it cut through it? Yes. All right. That is cutting through the key level. That key level can be inversed now. So, when time aligns with price, then it becomes important. So, you are not trading it here because 6 a.m. closed back above it. Time then aligns with price when 6 a.m. tomorrow closes below it because now time is aligning with price. And 10:00 a.m. can be an expansion candle downwards. This is how you trade and this is how you pass prop firms. Everyone asked me what's the quickest way to pass prop firms. 10:00 a.m.'s 4hour candle. That is the answer. If we go back in time and you look at all the big candles on NASDAQ, you will see a pattern. Most of them are 10:00 a.m. 10:00 a.m. 10:00 a.m. there, 10:00 a.m. here. Most of them at 10:00 a.m. Let's dive into some of this. Right, this price price action was a lot harder because it was working within a range. But the big candles here are 10:00 a.m. continuations. Take a look at this. Right, that there. What is that? That's an immediate rebalance. Why is this valid? Well, think about this. We took out a range low and we traded higher. We traded away from it. And then 6 a.m.'s candle, remember how I said it proves itself to you for 10:00 a.m. It closes above the previous candles. The body's there. 10:00 a.m. comes down, open, low, high, close. Okay, into a logical premium level. Look at this as well. We come into what is a discount key level here because it's a new week opening gap on the lower time frame. Go into it and check it yourself. Now, we traded this inside of the 1:1 group. And if you want access to that, you can apply with the top link in the description. But we traded this, right? Why was 10:00 a.m. predictably bullish? Why was that? Because we came into a discount key level. And look what 6 a.m. did. Remember what we just said back here? I'm not sure if it's still on the screen, but remember what we said about if you have a discount key level and you wanted to go long, would you want to see it respected or would you want to see it traded through? Respected. So 6 a.m. respects the key level. It fills it, but look at the body. Where does the body close here? Above the key level, which is an hourly actual gap, new week opening gap. It closes above it. So 10:00 a.m. is predictably bullish. What do you wait for when 10:00 a.m. is predictably bullish? Open, low. Okay, low there, high, close. This is how you align yourself with the market. This is how every single week I am aligning myself with the market. It's literally the only thing that makes me money in this game because I don't need anything else. Now, I mentioned I wanted to teach something about what key levels are important, and you've probably never been taught this on YouTube before, and this is why I want to dive into it. So, on NASDAQ, you have a few key times. You have the main ones of 3:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m., and again, this is EST, which is London session. You then have 8:30 to 11:00 a.m. and you also have PM session which is 1:30 till about 4. You have these key times on NASDAQ. All right. So with these key times in mind, you want PD arrays. Now let's ask a question. PD arrays. Which PD arrays are important? Okay. Are you looking at random PD arrays or are certain ones important? And some of you who have studied my content hard know what I'm about to say. It would be very few though. PD arrays, which PD arrays are important? And we can answer that question by saying ones created during a kill zone. And I pretty much guarantee you have never been taught this before. Which PD arrays are important? the ones created during one of these times. So, when you're on your 15-minute chart and you are looking at PD rays, why when we're trading lower here, why is this my key level? All right, this area here, these up close candles, why is this my key level? Why is this a valid change in the state of delivery? Why is this a valid order block now to go lower from 3 to 5 a.m. 3 to 5 a.m. This this move higher when it gets closed below it's valid to be used as an order block. Why is that? Because it was created during a kill zone. And you'll see every PD array that gets created during a kill zone is important. Okay, these are the important ones. You are not looking at the other ones. If it was created before or after one of these times, not important. Ignore it. Literally, don't use it. Literally, imagine the chart without it in because it's that it the algorithm is not referring to that. So, when you look at this inverse for V gap and when it got traded through on the downside, why is it valid to go lower from? Why should it hold for lower prices? Look at what time this was created. 9:45. This fits into this. So, it's valid. And these are the important things that no one is teaching you on YouTube that you just wouldn't know before. Why does this F value gap up here hold? All right. Why does it hold and go lower from that point? Why is it so accurate when it goes into that gap and trades lower? Why is that created during a kill zone? What time was this created? half 3, 1:30 to 4:00. That is PM session. That's P prime PM session. This is a valid premium array. And it's why I say you need one time frame because if you're predicting the candle, the 10 a.m. 4-hour candle, and it is respecting these key premium arrays on a lower time frame. It is predictable. Time before price. You've just never been taught really how to use time. All right? And when I speak about framework here, and I've I told my guys I wasn't going to teach this, but most people will just not pick up on what I'm about to teach. If you think about this yearly candle, and I know a lot of people are saying, yearly candle, what are you talking about? Why are you on the yearly chart? Open, low, high, close. What did I tell you is likely to happen? If you have a bullish expansion candle, you have an open, you have a low, you have a high, and a close. When is this high to close portion likely to be created? When do you think? The end of the year. We're coming towards the end of the year. So why was last week bearish on NASDAQ when everyone was longing? Why was it a bearish week when literally everyone was long? You think about that yearly candle. When is it likely to create that open to close portion during the last few months? We are in the last few months. That is why price was predictably bearish. Okay. When did the year open? All the way back here. January. This isn't a continuous contract, which is why you can't see it. January back here. Open. Think about a yearly candle. Open low. Okay. High. And the potential for a close. So time logic isn't just limited to kill zones. Time logic applies to every single candle you could ever think of. The monthly candle, the weekly candle. Why does TGIF work? Why does Friday sometimes trade back into the weekly range? Because of this concept, open, low, high, close, and open, high, low, close. The three-month candle and the yearly candle. When is the top wick likely to be created? during the last two months of trading and that is why I was bearish last week. This is what I mean when I mean framework and then you pair in okay well if it's going to be bearish where is logical levels that it's going to reach for potentially down here at some point cuz that's accumulation manipulation distribution and this is how you actually trade. I'm going to cut it there because I don't want to fry your brains too much. But honestly, guys, if you pair some of this up with just predicting that 10 a.m. candle, you will make money in this game and it will become so easy. I don't want to fry your brain, so I'm going to leave it there. Like I say, if you want to grab my free course, I think it's the second link in the description. If you want to apply to work with me onetoone where we can have one-to-one sessions weekly like this where I'm teaching you real stuff, apply with the top link in the description. As for me, I thank you as always for watching and I'll see you guys next time.","word_count":3916,"segment_count":546}
